

This project requires Android Studio 3.0 to build and run. This app toggles between three lists of people.

This application has a caching layer so that list of people and their avatars are only requested from the internet one time.

Unit tests should be added for the caching behavior. Switching the avatar background color would be desirable when selecting the different nav items.

This project uses picasso, butterknife, rxjava, and okhhtp and implements a MVP architecture.
