# Ranger Android Test

This project requires Android Studio 3.0 Beta 6 to build and run. This app toggles between three lists of people. 

The goal is to add a caching layer so the list of people and their avatars are only requested from the internet one time. Unit tests should be added for the caching behavior. Switching the avatar background color would be desirable when selecting the different nav items. Third party libraries are discouraged except where they make the most sense (e.g. threading, view binding, etc.), and falls in line with best practices for making a clean and manageable codebase. 

You should address any issues you see with the existing code (architecture, best practices, design patterns, etc.)
